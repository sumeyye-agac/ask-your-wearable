One entry per working session. Newest at the bottom. Format is in `CLAUDE.md`.

### 2026-11-11
- Reviewed the project proposal against current documentation and wrote `docs/REVIEW.md`.
  Four findings changed the plan: Hugging Face Spaces no longer offers a free Docker tier,
  the Kaggle dataset copy is mislabelled CC0 (the Zenodo original is CC BY 4.0), the Zepp
  export has no documented format, and the proposed RAG layer was too small to be real retrieval.
- Applied six decisions: Streamlit Community Cloud for hosting (Docker kept for CI only),
  the Zenodo dataset instead of the Kaggle copy, a documented CSV upload instead of Zepp,
  a `get_guideline(topic)` tool instead of RAG, Claude Haiku 5.5 as the model, and an 8-day plan.
- Marked `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` as approved and rewrote it with those decisions and the plan.
- Replaced the multi-file documentation system with this single log. Rewrote `CLAUDE.md`,
  replaced the `wrap-up` command, deleted `docs/LEARNING.md`.
- How to check it: read `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` for the agreed scope and `docs/REVIEW.md` §1 for
  the verified facts behind each decision.
- Open issues: no code written yet. Day 1 starts with loading the two Zenodo zips and printing a
  coverage table — how many users have sleep and heart rate data, and how many days each covers,
  is still unverified and decides the tool list and the question set.
